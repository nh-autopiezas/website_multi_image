TODO: master
===================
* Image magnification
  * Options
    * Magnifier.js: https://github.com/mark-rolich/Magnifier.js
    * Zoom (jQuery): https://github.com/jackmoore/zoom/tree/master
    * BootstrapMagnify: https://github.com/marcaube/bootstrap-magnify

* Secondary Image (on Mouseover) (Category list view and grid view)
* Image thumbnail preview widget in admin list view (to replace current download link)
* Attach Images to product variants to allow for image galleries based on product variants. This will be designed to switch galleries based on product variant attributes (eg. colour, size, etc.).
* Add product variant swatch thumbnails in a similar manner to Magento 1.9.1 (eg. t-if from tags or labels).
* Add support for WebRotate360 module website_webrotate360 (*not yet built).
* Add support for importing multiple images from URL or local path as default to allow for a more user-friendly mass update/import of product images in a similar manner to the Magmi project for Magento
